## Important Notes

### Commits

Once you clone the repository and make some changes you would need to make commits. You cannot just add anything in the commit body. This repository follows conventional commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ to standardise commit messages and make them more informative, as well as descriptive. When you automatically attempt to commit, if your commit message does not follow the specification as given in conventional commits, then your commit will fail.
